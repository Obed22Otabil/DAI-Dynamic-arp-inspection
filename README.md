Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) is configured to protect the network from ARP spoofing and ARP poisoning attacks.
It works by validating ARP packets on the network and allowing only trusted ARP messages that match legitimate IP–MAC bindings.

DAI helps to:
Prevent attackers from sending fake ARP replies
Stop man-in-the-middle attacks
Ensure accurate IP-to-MAC address mapping
Improve overall network security and reliability
